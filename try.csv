For example, in a national study of parents of high school students, almost a tenth of the parents (9%) reported that a firearm-related incident had occurred in their child's school within the past 5 years (e.g., student found with gun on campus, bullet found, student threatened peers with guns, etc.)	Firearm violence remains a significant problem in the US (with 2787 adolescents killed in 2015). However, the research on school firearm violence prevention practices and policies is scant. Parents are major stakeholders in relation to firearm violence by youths and school safety in general. The purpose of this study was to examine what parents thought schools should be doing to reduce the risk of firearm violence in schools. A valid and reliable questionnaire was mailed to a national random sample of 600 parents who had at least one child enrolled in a public secondary school (response rate=47%). Parents perceived inadequate parental monitoring/rearing practices (73%), peer harassment and/or bullying (58%), inadequate mental health care services for youth (54%), and easy access to guns (51%) as major causes of firearm violence in schools. The school policies perceived to be most effective in reducing firearm violence were installing an alert system in schools (70%), working with law enforcement to design an emergency response plan (70%), creating a comprehensive security plan (68%), requiring criminal background checks for all school personnel prior to hiring (67%), and implementing an anonymous system for students to report peer concerns regarding potential violence (67%).

A report by Karthik et al. (2014), revealed their presence in the marine saline soil is an indication of an adaptation process which might have established during application	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 mg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (<45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-b and down regulation of TNF-a in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development. 	0.1412627249956131	L. Karthik 	neutral

transformer models	The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data. 	0.09917327016592026	Ashish Vaswani 	good

SWEET-HOME [21] is a nationally supported French research project that aims to design a new smart home system based on audio technology. This project has three main goals: providing an audio-based interaction technology that lets the users have full control over their home environment, detecting distress situations and easing the social inclusion of the elderly and frail population	Smart homes equipped with ambient intelligence technology constitute a promising direction to enable the growing number of elderly to continue to live in their own home as long as possible. However, this calls for technological solutions that suit their specific needs and capabilities. The SWEET-HOME project aims at developing a new user friendly technology for home automation based on voice command. This paper reports a user evaluation assessing the acceptance and fear of this new technology. Eight healthy persons between 71 and 88 years old, 7 relatives (child, grandchild or friend) and 3 professional carers participated in a user evaluation. During about 45 min, the persons were questioned in co-discovery in the DOMUS smart home alternating between interview and wizard of Oz periods followed by a debriefing. The experience aimed at testing four important aspects of the project: voice command, communication with the outside world, domotics system interrupting a person’s activity, and electronic agenda. Voice interface appeared to have a great potential to ease daily living for elderly and frail persons and would be better accepted than more intrusive solutions. By considering still healthy and independent elderly people in the user evaluation, an interesting finding that came up is their overall acceptance provided the system does not drive them to a lazy lifestyle by taking control of everything. This particular fear must be addressed for the development of smart homes that support daily living by giving them more ability to control rather than putting them away from the daily routine. 	0.17622171342372894	François Portet	good

The  interaction  between  emotional/motivational  state,acoustic output and facial expression is a largely unexploredbranch of vocal communication(also see Ohala, 1984;Auberge ́& Cathiard, 2003; Chuenwattanapranithiet al.,2008; Drahotaet al., 2008)	Visual expression alone (a smile or a laugh) is often enough to identify an emotion such as amusement:in a perception task, subjects correctly identified visual and audio–visual stimuli of amused speech to the same degree (Proceedings of ICSLP, Sydney, 1998, p. 559), but even from the acoustic signal alone it has been demonstrated that the consequences of a (mechanical) smile gesture can be perceived as amusement (JASA 96 (1994) 2101). A hypothesis developed in the present work is that the expression of amusement in speech involves specific control of prosody and cannot be reduced simply to a change in voice quality as a consequence of the facial smile gesture. Speech stimuli were produced by French speakers for various tasks (spontaneous amusement, simulated amusement, mechanical smiling, ...), and in a first experiment, listeners were able to identify speech from the spontaneous smile condition as more amused than the ‘‘mechanical smile’’. It was shown from a second experiment that, even under clear visual conditions, the auditory modality contributes to audio–visual perception. A McGurk paradigm applied to discordant amused/mechanical stimuli clearly showed that acoustic information interacts with the visual decoding. The stimuli were analysed using a set of parameters chosen following Tartter (Percept. Psychophys. 27 (1980) 24), Banse and Scherer (J. Pers. Soc. Psych. 170 (1996) 614) and Mozziconacci (PhD Thesis, Eindhoren University, 1998). The prosodic parameters affected in the expression of amusement are primarily intensity and F0 declination, but they are different for different speakers. Our results confirm the finding by Mozziconacci (PhD Thesis, Eindhoren University, 1998), that there may be numerous ways of using the same parameters to express emotions such as amusement. 	0.1111888661980629	Veronique Auberge 	good
