School Firearm Violence Prevention Practices and Policies: Functional or Folly?	For example, in a national study of parents of high school students, almost a tenth of the parents (9%) reported that a firearm-related incident had occurred in their child's school within the past 5 years (e.g., student found with gun on campus, bullet found, student threatened peers with guns, etc.)	Firearm injuries are the third leading cause of death for youth (14% of all deaths of youth 1–19 years of age). In 2016, there were 3155 firearm deaths of youths <19 years of age. Recently, school firearm violence and school shootings have received increasing attention from school personnel, policymakers, and in the mass media. However, little is known about prevention and reduction of school firearm violence. The purpose of this narrative review is to describe the current practices regarding school firearm violence prevention and use of the disease prevention and health promotion framework to describe current practices and policies on school firearm violence prevention measures. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted from the years 2000 to 2018 to search for school-based practices to reduce firearm violence. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to harden schools. None of the currently employed school firearm violence prevention methods have empirical evidence to show that they actually diminish firearm violence in schools. To the extent that schools adopt ineffective firearm violence prevention measures, they are creating a false sense of security. School systems need to engage in collaborative research for evidence-based practices and policy advocacy through coalition building to address state firearm laws. Schools also need to expand their mental health services and cost-effective educational interventions for reducing violence (e.g., bullying, peer mediation, conflict resolution, etc.). Hardening of schools seems to be a questionable endeavor for most schools, given the dearth of evidence regarding effectiveness.

However, the research on school firearm violence prevention practices and policies is scant. Parents are major stakeholders in relation to firearm violence by youths and school safety in general. The purpose of this study was to examine what parents thought schools should be doing to reduce the risk of firearm violence in schools. A valid and reliable questionnaire was mailed to a national random sample of 600 parents who had at least one child enrolled in a public secondary school (response rate=47%). Parents perceived inadequate parental monitoring/rearing practices (73%), peer harassment and/or bullying (58%), inadequate mental health care services for youth (54%), and easy access to guns (51%) as major causes of firearm violence in schools. The school policies perceived to be most effective in reducing firearm violence were installing an alert system in schools (70%), working with law enforcement to design an emergency response plan (70%), creating a comprehensive security plan (68%), requiring criminal background checks for all school personnel prior to hiring (67%), and implementing an anonymous system for students to report peer concerns regarding potential violence (67%). Parents seem to have a limited grasp of potentially effective interventions to reduce firearm violence. 	Erika Payton	10.1007/s10900-017-0360-5 	good
Arming Schoolteachers: What Do We Know? Where Do We Go From Here?	a recent study that used a national sample found that more than half of the parents of school-aged children oppose school personnel carrying firearms	The recent mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, has reignited a national conversation about arming teachers. Although gun violence prevention research has been historically underfunded,1 there has been strong support for studying the prevalence of violent behaviors more broadly in schools and the role of preventive efforts (via curricula, increased social support services, and parent engagement) in reducing these behaviors. However, we know little, if anything, about the effectiveness of arming teachers in deterring gun violence in schools. Furthermore, uncertainty about how schools should operationalize this kind of proposal perpetuates concerns.As teachers, school administrators, parents, and policymakers seek to build safer school communities, we need a far better understanding of the implications of arming teachers on the school environment, on a child's development, on student learning outcomes, on existing school safety policies, and on the full costs of such interventions, including the added responsibilities that it would impose on teachers and school administrators. We arm uniformed police officers with the expectation that they have been appropriately trained to protect us with their firearms in times of crisis. Although teachers are conceivably capable of appropriately using firearms, no evidence-based guidelines are available to help us develop the necessary training for teachers and continued instruction needed to maintain their preparedness so that they would be ready when crisis strikes. We also have no means for identifying teachers who would be willing to take on this significant responsibility. Nor do we have enough information on whether nonuniformed, armed civilian teachers would reduce or increase risks for themselves and their students when uniformed law enforcement arrives during a crisis. In other words, we are debating whether a new profession that combines the responsibilities of a law enforcement officer and a teacher is even feasible, given all these caveats.

A Scoping Review of Police Involvement in School Crisis Response for Mental Health Emergencies	In one survey, parents were supportive of school-law enforcement partnerships to promote safety and respond to violence in schools, and they also saw a relationship between improving mental health services generally and reducing school violence	The purpose of this scoping literature review was to examine research on police involvement in school mental health crisis response. The search was conducted in PsychInfo, PubMed, and ERIC and initially identified 315 articles. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 47 articles remained. Detailed review and data extraction by three independent reviewers resulted in a final article count of nine. Three primary themes were identified across articles: (1) perceptions and consequences of law enforcement presence in schools; (2) the role of school-community partnerships in successful crisis response models; and (3) gaps in research and challenges of implementing and scaling existing models. Though in practice law enforcement officers are often involved in school mental health crisis response, there is limited empirical research supporting this approach. Our review did not return any randomized trials. In the absence of empirical evidence supporting the use of current models, there is a need for research on law enforcement involvement in school crisis response and, more broadly, community-partnered models of responding to student mental health needs.

Teacher Preparedness for School Shootings: A Qualitative Design and Development Model Use Case Study	Since the tragic events at Columbine in April 1999, many schools across the country began safety initiatives with or without the help of law enforcement and other trained professionals	Many industries implement online learning for training and professional development to enhance the student experience. The specific problem addressed in this study was school staff do not have adequate knowledge of mitigating violence, such as school shootings, with ineffective current professional development. This design and development model use case study aimed to use a validated instructional design model to design, develop, and implement professional development for K–12 teachers and staff to mitigate school shooting risks as informed by content experts. The conceptual framework for this study consisted of constructivism and interpretivism theories for adult students. The student experience was assessed with Kirkpatrick’s evaluation Levels 1 and 2. The samples for this qualitative study included three content experts and four K– 12 teachers. Data were analyzed using deductive and inductive coding and Clarke and Braun’s six steps of thematic analysis after coding using NVivo. K–12 teachers found value in the content and delivery of the improved professional development and feel better prepared to assist troubled students and prevent violence. The teachers expressed positive feedback about continuing such training and performed well on the summative assessment. Study implications are using a validated instructional design model and panel of experts to improve the student experience and professional development content improves preparedness. Sensitive content can be effectively delivered using instructional design best practices. Participants feel better prepared to work with others in the community, such as law enforcement, to improve training. This study contributes to practice by demonstrating how professional development about school shootings can be relevant and engaging. Social-Emotional Learning programs and practices should expand, and K–12 teachers and staff must foster partnerships with local law enforcement and other emergency management experts.

PUBLIC SCHOOL SAFETY AND INTERVENTION PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH	The purpose of the study was to assess parental thoughts on what high school administrators should be doing to reduce the risk of firearm violence in schools	Participatory action research is a process in which researchers operate as full collaborators with members of an organization (stakeholders) in linking theory and research to acceptable and effective practice. Schools are being charged to use this approach to address the challenges of developing system-level interventions for many of their current problematic areas, such as family-school partnerships with economically disadvantaged and culturally and linguistically diverse families. Participatory action research is a means for school psychologists, as participatory researchers, to provide leadership for collaborative research within schools for the development of system-level interventions. A case study is described in which a school psychologist served as the participatory researcher in an action research process for the development of a family-school partnership program in a Chapter I, ethnically and linguistically diverse elementary school. The outcomes indicated that the participatory action research process resulted in the design and implementation of a research-based family-school partnership program that was culturally specific, was acceptable to stakeholders (parents and teachers), and had the potential for sustainability. Participatory action research is a viable means for school psychologists to provide leadership in developing research-based, effective and acceptable system-level interventions in their schools.

Outcome of Vacuum Assisted Dressing in Open Comminuted Tibial Fracture with Primary Fixation	Vacuum assisted closure (VAC) (Kinche, Concepts, Inc, San Antonio, TX, USA) treatment provides a good environment that allows for both open and closed treatment, better wound healing procedures under moist, hygienic, sterile conditions.	The simultaneous exposure of tissue and bone poses specific management challenges. Patients with extended soft tissue damage and high-grade compound fractures present a demanding clinical challenge, requiring a complex approach and multiple orthopaedic, plastic, and vascular-reconstructive procedures. Management involves combinations of wound debridement and closure by secondary intention, use of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) devices, and various reconstructive plastic surgery methods. We present three consecutive complicated cases, involving compound fractures of the lower limb with massive soft tissue damage (Gustilo-Anderson type IIIB) that were managed with debridement, application of external fixation and VAC device. The mean wound size was 24 cm in length and 12 cm in width. The aim of treatment was to cover the bone with soft tissue and achieve healing of the fracture without persistent infection. Wound healing was achieved in all three cases within 30-42 days (mean 34). In one case, the skin graft was applied on day 33.  Utilizing this method as part of a multi-directional approach, the VAC system helps the patient recover faster. Moreover, it acts as a feasible and valuable method to treat compound fractures with massive soft-tissue defects. VAC can replace microsurgical soft-tissue transfer, reduce the risk of infection and allow salvaging the limb.

Herbal immune-boosters: Substantial warriors of pandemic Covid-19 battle	A report by Karthik et al. (2014), revealed their presence in the marine saline soil is an indication of an adaptation process which might have established during application	Current scenario depicts that world has been clenched by COVID-19 pandemic. Inevitably, public health and safety measures could be undertaken in order to dwindle the infection threat and mortality. Moreover, to overcome the global menace and drawing out world from moribund stage, there is an exigency for social distancing and quarantines. Since December, 2019, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) have came into existence and up till now world is still in the state of shock.At this point of time, COVID-19 has entered perilous phase, creating havoc among individuals, and this has been directly implied due to enhanced globalisation and ability of the virus to acclimatize at all conditions. The unabated transmission is due to lack of drugs, vaccines and therapeutics against this viral outbreak. But research is still underway to formulate the vaccines or drugs by this means, as scientific communities are continuously working to unravel the pharmacologically active compounds that might offer a new insight for curbing infections and pandemics. Therefore, the topical COVID-19 situation highlights an immediate need for effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Towards this effort, the present review discusses the vital concepts related to COVID-19, in terms of its origin, transmission, clinical aspects and diagnosis. However, here, we have formulated the novel concept hitherto, ancient means of traditional medicines or herbal plants to beat this pandemic.

Global quantitative and qualitative assessment of drought research from 1861 to 2019	Such a dual approach moreover allows for the determination of national/international research interests as well as performance in a particular field (in this case droughts) in order to pre-inform national/international future research plans, priorities, fund allocations, and partnership outsourcing for collaborations, among other things	Over the last 150 years, there has been a dramatic increase in research focusing on droughts in every part of the world, due to their negative impacts on multiple sectors, the functioning of ecosystems and human wellbeing. However, our understanding of the long-term trends of drought-related research remains limited. Therefore, this study is aimed at providing a generalised quantitative and qualitative synthesis of drought-related research publications from 1861 to 2019 in the Scopus database, using bibliometric and science mapping analytics. Title-speciﬁc field drought-related articles were mined and analysed for explanatory characteristics to identify different research trends, global and national interests and their contributions’. The results of the synthesis revealed a total of 26,221 articles from 45,329 authors and 3181 journals. The annual research production in drought-related research thus exhibited a 7.87% annual growth rate during this period from 1861 to 2019. Drought as a central theme witnessed a mean growth rate (MGR) of 8170% in the last 3 years (2017–2019). The prevailing topics include drought tolerance, resilience, climate change, and drought resistance, which had MGRs of 1100%, 530%, 2030% and 70% in 2017–2019, respectively. With an MGR of 1030%, remote sensing appeared to be a widespread method used in the monitoring of meteorological drought (600%), agricultural drought (730%), and hydrological drought (330%). Four trending thematic areas identified in drought-related research from 1861 to 2019 were climate change-related; physiology and biochemistry in plant/herb photosynthesis; molecular genetics and mechanisms of drought impacts (stress), tolerance and resistance in crops/plants; and emerging concept related to the circadian rhythms of biological systems in drought conditions. It also emerged from an analysis of the thematic areas that drought-related research in South Africa focused on agriculture and food-security, water-security, environmental sustainability, socioeconomics (among others) during the relevant period.

Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 mg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (<45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-b and down regulation of TNF-a in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development. 	L. Karthik 	13.1371/journal.pone.0090972 	bad
Depression, anxiety, stress and their associated factors among Ethiopian University students during an early stage of COVID-19 pandemic: An online-based cross-sectional survey	Those without clear information are liable to misinformation and there is a growing body of literature that reveals the link between misinformation and mental illness	The occurrence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the mental health situation of almost everyone, including University students who spent most of their time at home due to the closure of the Universities. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing depression, anxiety, stress and identifying their associated factors among university students in Ethiopia during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. We invited students to complete an online survey using Google forms comprising consent, socio-demographic characteristics, and the standard validated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire. After completion of the survey from June 30 to July 30, 2020, we exported the data into SPSS 22. Both descriptive and analytical statistics were computed. Associated factors were identified using binary logistic regression and variables with a p-value <0.05 were declared as statistically significant factors with the outcome variables. A total of 423 students completed the online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in this study was 46.3%, 52%, and 28.6%, respectively. In the multivariable model, female sex, poor self-efficacy to prevent COVID-19, those who do not read any material about COVID-19 prevention, lack of access to reading materials about their profession, and lack of access to uninterrupted internet access were significantly associated with depression. Female sex, lower ages, students with non-health-related departments, those who do not think that COVID-19 is preventable, and those who do not read any materials about COVID-19 prevention were significantly associated with anxiety. Whereas, being female, students attending 1st and 2nd years, those who do not think that COVID-19 is preventable, presence of confirmed COVID-19 patient at the town they are living in, and lack of access to reading materials about their profession were significantly associated with stress. Depression, anxiety, and stress level among University students calls for addressing these problems by controlling the modifiable factors identified and promoting psychological wellbeing of students.
