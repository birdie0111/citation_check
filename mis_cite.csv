Networking the Relationships of Microenterprise Development in Bulgaria	Other design approaches, such as grounded theory, are similarly inappropriate because the purpose of grounded theory is to compare empirical findings to the conceptual theory based on inductive interpretation (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).	The networking relationships provided by microenterprise development (MED) organizations foster sustainable and scalable Bulgarian small businesses. Some Bulgarian MED leaders lack the strategies to help sustain small businesses in Bulgaria. Guided by the actor network theory, the purpose of this case study was to explore the strategies MED leaders use to help sustain small businesses in Bulgaria. Data were collected through a semistructured focus group comprised of MED Bulgarian business leaders (n = 4) in Rhodope Mountain Region and company data consisting of financial reports, marketing presentations, and company business plan. The data analysis included using keyword frequency comparisons, coding techniques, and cluster analysis. Three themes emerged from the findings: access to financial and nonfinancial capital, networking and relationships, and sustainability and scalability. According to the study results, strategies and scalability impede the ability to expand and service more small business owners. The recommended change in business practices of MED leaders included the formalization of networks of other MED leaders and partner organizations to efficiently meet the demands of the Bulgarian small business market. The implications for social change include the need for networks to aid entrepreneurs in gaining market access, obtaining capital resources, and maintaining sustainability that contributes to the economic and social development of Bulgaria.

A methodological study of sample-size reporting in focus group studies 	Among those stating that they had reached a point of saturation, several appeared not to have followed principles from grounded theory where data collection and analysis is an iterative process until saturation is reached. 	Background: Focus group studies are increasingly published in health related journals, but we know little abouthow researchers use this method, particularly how they determine the number of focus groups to conduct. Themethodological literature commonly advises researchers to follow principles of data saturation, although practicaladvise on how to do this is lacking. Our objectives were firstly, to describe the current status of sample size infocus group studies reported in health journals. Secondly, to assess whether and how researchers explain thenumber of focus groups they carry out. Methods: We searched PubMed for studies that had used focus groups and that had been published in open access journals during 2008, and extracted data on the number of focus groups and on any explanation authorsgave for this number. We also did a qualitative assessment of the papers with regard to how number of groupswas explained and discussed. Results: We identified 220 papers published in 117 journals. In these papers insufficient reporting of sample sizes was common. The number of focus groups conducted varied greatly (mean 8.4, median 5, range 1 to 96). Thirtyseven (17%) studies attempted to explain the number of groups. Six studies referred to rules of thumb in theliterature, three stated that they were unable to organize more groups for practical reasons, while 28 studies statedthat they had reached a point of saturation. Among those stating that they had reached a point of saturation,several appeared not to have followed principles from grounded theory where data collection and analysis is aniterative process until saturation is reached. Studies with high numbers of focus groups did not offer explanationsfor number of groups. Too much data as a study weakness was not an issue discussed in any of the reviewedpapers. Conclusions: Based on these findings we suggest that journals adopt more stringent requirements for focus groupmethod reporting. The often poor and inconsistent reporting seen in these studies may also reflect the lack ofclear, evidence-based guidance about deciding on sample size.

Methods: We searched PubMed for studies that had used focus groups and that had been published in open access journals during 2008, and extracted data on the number of focus groups and on any explanation authorsgave for this number. We also did a qualitative assessment of the papers with regard to how number of groupswas explained and discussed. Results: We identified 220 papers published in 117 journals. In these papers insufficient reporting of sample sizes was common. The number of focus groups conducted varied greatly (mean 8.4, median 5, range 1 to 96). Thirtyseven (17%) studies attempted to explain the number of groups. Six studies referred to rules of thumb in theliterature, three stated that they were unable to organize more groups for practical reasons, while 28 studies statedthat they had reached a point of saturation. Among those stating that they had reached a point of saturation,several appeared not to have followed principles from grounded theory where data collection and analysis is aniterative process until saturation is reached. Studies with high numbers of focus groups did not offer explanationsfor number of groups. Too much data as a study weakness was not an issue discussed in any of the reviewedpapers. Conclusions: Based on these findings we suggest that journals adopt more stringent requirements for focus groupmethod reporting. The often poor and inconsistent reporting seen in these studies may also reflect the lack ofclear, evidence-based guidance about deciding on sample size. More empirical research is needed to developfocus group methodology. 	Carlsen and Glenton 	10.1186/1471-2288-11-35	error
Networking the Relationships of Microenterprise Development in Bulgaria	A researcher must balance quantity of focus groups with the quality of rich data; too few or too many groups and participants can impact the quality of the findings (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).	The networking relationships provided by microenterprise development (MED) organizations foster sustainable and scalable Bulgarian small businesses. Some Bulgarian MED leaders lack the strategies to help sustain small businesses in Bulgaria. Guided by the actor network theory, the purpose of this case study was to explore the strategies MED leaders use to help sustain small businesses in Bulgaria. Data were collected through a semistructured focus group comprised of MED Bulgarian business leaders (n = 4) in Rhodope Mountain Region and company data consisting of financial reports, marketing presentations, and company business plan. The data analysis included using keyword frequency comparisons, coding techniques, and cluster analysis. Three themes emerged from the findings: access to financial and nonfinancial capital, networking and relationships, and sustainability and scalability. According to the study results, strategies and scalability impede the ability to expand and service more small business owners. The recommended change in business practices of MED leaders included the formalization of networks of other MED leaders and partner organizations to efficiently meet the demands of the Bulgarian small business market. The implications for social change include the need for networks to aid entrepreneurs in gaining market access, obtaining capital resources, and maintaining sustainability that contributes to the economic and social development of Bulgaria.

Determinants of cross-shopping behaviour among modern and traditional food retail stores in Indonesia: An empirical analysis of Riau Province	Carlsen and Glenton (2011) suggested that the researcher undertake two to five group discussions for each group of participants, then observe the point of saturation as the discussions progress in order to make decisions about the final number of groups required.

Mixed-method approach was applied to explore consumers’ purchasing behaviour for food, cooking oil, chicken meat and kangkong.

Determinants of cross-shopping behaviour among modern and traditional food retail stores in Indonesia: An empirical analysis of Riau Province	The quality of a qualitative study depends on the breadth of the data collected.

Determinants of cross-shopping behaviour among modern and traditional food retail stores in Indonesia: An empirical analysis of Riau Province	Carlsen and Glenton (2011) reviewed more than 200 studies published in health-related journals and found that there was a great deal of variation in the number of focus groups used, ranging from 1 to 96.

Perceptions of Fidelity and Adaptation in Evidence-Informed Interventions by Women of Color Sexuality Health Educators	This study reached saturation when the data was deemed both thick and rich, no new themes emerged from focus group discussions, and five focus groups had been completed (136,139).	Sexuality health educators (SHEs) adapt interventions to the participants’ needs in the dissemination and implementation of comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) programming. However, there is a lack of understanding of how, why and when SHEs make such adaptations. Success or failure of the transfer of prevention technology to practitioners occurs by determining community capacities and preparedness to adopt/adapt high-impact interventions to effectively manage implementation. Experts argue for evidence-informed interventions (EII), as opposed to evidence-based interventions (EBI), as the best way to incorporate research in applied settings. EBIs are solely guided by recommendations from current evidence, whereas EIIs recognize and incorporate the practitioner’s judgment and professional expertise in the context of program implementation. This exploratory study used qualitative methods, purposive sampling and an inductive approach. Semi-structured focus groups explored perceptions of adaptation and fidelity with women of color (WOC) SHEs currently implementing CSE behavioral interventions with young women of color (YWOC). Five focus groups were facilitated in total (one face-to-face, four virtually, via Google Hangouts); n=24, with an average of five participants per focus group. Focus groups were audio and video (online only) recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. The research team coded transcripts using Dedoose Qualitative Research Software, and conducted analysis using Grounded Theory methodology. Three dominant themes and sixteen related sub-themes were identified using a number of analytic approaches, including: simultaneous coding, values coding, calculating frequency, comparing and contrasting emerging themes, language comparison and language analysis (i.e. metaphors, analogies, similes), research team memos, and noting participants’ non-verbal cues.

An exploration of evidence of deficits and theories of therapy for specific-receptive language impairment in children	Although saturation was reached after only a relatively small number of focus groups, this was thought to be beneficial in allowing more in-depth analysis (Carlsen and Glenton 2011).	Children with specific receptive language impairments (SRLI) have been found to be vulnerable to negative outcomes later in life, in terms of mental health, behaviour and literacy. Currently there is little evidence of the efficacy of speech and language therapy in this area, and a dearth of studies that have investigated interventions for receptive language. Following recommended steps from the Medical Research Council’s guidance for the development of complex interventions, this research focuses on identifying and developing evidence and theory for interventions for SRLI. Evidence of deficit was first explored in a systematic literature review (SLR), examining the nature of the cognitive and linguistic deficits in children with SRLI. Grammar and word learning were identified as areas of particular difficulty for this population. Deficits in information processing, in particular short term and working memory, were also identified as playing a role in these children’s impairments. However, a number of issues were identified with the validity of studies Theories of therapy were examined in relation to the areas of deficit identified in the SLR through examination of existing intervention studies for children with SRLI, and exploring expert speech and language therapists (SLTs) views in focus groups. Three focus groups with 16 expert SLTs were conducted, followed by a larger group with 23 SLTs who had a range of experience. The groups explored intervention approaches for SRLI, in relation to the deficits identified in the SLR, as well as their rationales for these interventions. It was found that SLTs did not often refer to explicit theories underpinning their intervention for SRLI and had difficulty describing processes of change. However, thematic analysis revealed core therapy components, as well as common approaches for selecting targets across groups. Responses also indicated that the interventions SLTs describe often focus on children’s participation and functioning rather than impairment. The findings of the research are used to present a model of interventions for SRLI. The findings are also drawn upon to examine possible mechanisms of change in interventions for children with SRLI.  In the area.	Morgan, L. 	0	What about N? A methodological study of sample-size reporting in focus group studies 	when authors had included only a small number of focus groups, they frequently described this as a limitation. However, in several of these studies, authors also claimed the number of focus groups had been determined by data saturation. This should, in theory, imply that the number of focus groups was, in fact, appropriate. (See for example [38-43]). But while authors often described a small number of focus groups as a weakness, several studies justified their choice of method with reference to the possibilities that focus groups gave to go in depth and provide a thick description of the issue. 	Background: Focus group studies are increasingly published in health related journals, but we know little abouthow researchers use this method, particularly how they determine the number of focus groups to conduct. Themethodological literature commonly advises researchers to follow principles of data saturation, although practicaladvise on how to do this is lacking. Our objectives were firstly, to describe the current status of sample size infocus group studies reported in health journals. Secondly, to assess whether and how researchers explain thenumber of focus groups they carry out. Methods: We searched PubMed for studies that had used focus groups and that had been published in open access journals during 2008, and extracted data on the number of focus groups and on any explanation authorsgave for this number. We also did a qualitative assessment of the papers with regard to how number of groupswas explained and discussed. Results: We identified 220 papers published in 117 journals. In these papers insufficient reporting of sample sizes was common. The number of focus groups conducted varied greatly (mean 8.4, median 5, range 1 to 96). Thirtyseven (17%) studies attempted to explain the number of groups. Six studies referred to rules of thumb in theliterature, three stated that they were unable to organize more groups for practical reasons, while 28 studies statedthat they had reached a point of saturation. Among those stating that they had reached a point of saturation,several appeared not to have followed principles from grounded theory where data collection and analysis is aniterative process until saturation is reached. Studies with high numbers of focus groups did not offer explanationsfor number of groups. Too much data as a study weakness was not an issue discussed in any of the reviewedpapers. Conclusions: Based on these findings we suggest that journals adopt more stringent requirements for focus groupmethod reporting. The often poor and inconsistent reporting seen in these studies may also reflect the lack ofclear, evidence-based guidance about deciding on sample size. More empirical research is needed to developfocus group methodology. 	Carlsen and Glenton 	10.1186/1471-2288-11-45	error
Performance Factors that Influence Marketing Measurement in Successful Small Businesses	When a researcher derives no new data from interviewing, reviewing documents, or observing behaviors of additional cases, data saturation occurs (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).	During the 2009 economic recession, United States business leaders cut marketing expenditures between 33% and 50% more than they did for any other business expenditure to mitigate financial loss because business leaders often regard marketing as an expense and not an investment. Since there is not a widely applied marketing measurement standard, this multiple-case study focused on finding key performance indicators that healthcare and sales small business leaders in eastern United States with less than 500 employees, and marketing evaluation practices in place, used to evaluate the effectiveness of their marketing. Institutional theory was used as the conceptual framework to explore the key drivers behind marketing measurement practices. The focus of this study was on the experiences of 4 small business leaders in Atlanta, Georgia, and Baltimore, Maryland, who have developed financial and nonfinancial strategies to measure their marketing performance. Data collected for this study included 20-minute interviews with each participant, strategic plans, and field notes. A modified van Kaam and triangulation approach was used for data analysis to identify themes, which included the need to tie marketing measurement to the product or service offering and drive revenue or traffic to their business. The results of the study may benefit practitioners who work on social change strategies because the conclusions clarify effective marketing practices and increase well-being of customers. Further, this study provides recommendations for successful marketing measurement strategies that may help businesses meet the needs of community members.	Tareion Fluker 	0	What about N? A methodological study of sample-size reporting in focus group studies 	Strauss and Corbin state that researchers should collect data until “no new or relevant data seem to emerge regarding a category.” [15] (1990:188).

Performance Factors that Influence Marketing Measurement in Successful Small Businesses	I reached data saturation in that I derived no new data from the later interview participants (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011, Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Moustakas, 1994)	During the 2009 economic recession, United States business leaders cut marketing expenditures between 33% and 50% more than they did for any other business expenditure to mitigate financial loss because business leaders often regard marketing as an expense and not an investment.
