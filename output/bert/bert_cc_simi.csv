Other design approaches, such as grounded theory, are similarly inappropriate because the purpose of grounded theory is to compare empirical findings to the conceptual theory based on inductive interpretation (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).	Among those stating that they had reached a point of saturation, several appeared not to have followed principles from grounded theory where data collection and analysis is an iterative process until saturation is reached. 	0.27130234241485596	error

A purposeful sample set allows the researcher to choose organizations that fit the boundaries of the study (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).

A researcher uses a focus group discussion to combine various perspectives regarding a specific topic of interest to share information (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).

Carlsen and Glenton (2011) concluded that focus groups tend to contain a small number of participants and even fewer numbers of focus groups to promote interaction and communication among participants.	Thus, some authors suggest that if the number of participants in a study is small, it is possible to increase the number of groups by reducing the size of the groups [4]. 	0.3638649880886078	error
A general rule for data saturation in qualitative research occurs when no new themes emerge (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011; Walker, 2012).	the basic procedure of selecting informants and deciding on the number of groups through a constant process of analysing data and obtaining new data until no new essential information is found, remains. 	0.2521741986274719	error
A researcher ensures data saturation through the appropriate use of data collection methods that fit the research objectives and collecting data to the point that no new information emerges from the participants’ responses (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).	For good results, just a few focus groups are sufficient, as data become saturated and little new information emerges after the first few groups [Morgan 96] [55].

A researcher conducting a focus group session explores experiences and perspectives of a cross-section of key decision makers (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011; Gill, 2014).	By conducting a large number of focus groups with a significant cross-section of the facility’s employees, we reduced the possibility that results would be dramatically affected by a single focus group or methodological choice during coding [37]. 	0.2258055955171585	error

Carlsen and Glenton (2011) recommended at least two focus group sessions but due to limited availability of researcher and participants; only one focus group session occurred with follow-up discussions as necessary to achieve data and theme saturation.

Carlsen and Glenton (2011) suggested that the researcher undertake two to five group discussions for each group of participants, then observe the point of saturation as the discussions progress in order to make decisions about the final number of groups required.	 The recommendations and references to what is common regarding number of groups vary within these text books. In general they recommend from two to five groups per category of participants. However, the authors usually underline that these are only rules of thumb and that the number of focus groups depends on the complexity of the research question and the composition of the groups. Often, the advice given is to follow the rules of thumb but to suggest a slightly higher number to be “on the safe side”. Some authors suggest that the researchers then use point of saturation as they go along to decide the final number of groups needed [2,4].	0.2250896841287613	good
Carlsen and Glenton (2011) found that during the period between 1998 and 2008, the number of research papers using focus groups that were published in health journals had increased significantly.	The results from our searches from 1998, 2003 and 2008 support the claims that there has been an increase in focus group studies over the last ten years. 	0.3062201142311096	good
The quality of a qualitative study depends on the breadth of the data collected. This means that a limited sample size can be justified for focus group research because there is a tradeoff between the number of focus groups and the depth of the data collected (Carlsen and Glenton 2011). 	Nevertheless, the quality of qualitative studies does depend on the depth and richness of the data and its analysis. Reference to the trade-off between number of focus groups and the thickness of our description should therefore be an acceptable explanation for (a limited) sample size 	0.31977251172065735	good
Carlsen and Glenton (2011) reviewed more than 200 studies published in health-related journals and found that there was a great deal of variation in the number of focus groups used, ranging from 1 to 96. In these publications, all single-group researchers applied mixed methods, where focus groups were used as a pilot study to develop instruments for the quantitative stage of the research. At the other end of the scale, when the number of focus groups used was ten or more, researchers appeared to be attempting to quantify and thus to generalise their research findings.	We identified 220 papers published in 117 journals. In these papers insufficient reporting of sample sizes was common. The number of focus groups conducted varied greatly (mean 8.4, median 5, range 1 to 96). Also, all the single group studies were mixed methods studies, where the focus group typically was used as a pilot to develop or test a questionnaire for the survey part of the study. At the other end of the scale, one could also speculate that when the sample size reaches two-digit numbers, a “quantitative study logic” kicks in where a big N is seen as a positive asset and therefore less important to justify.	0.2917539179325104	good
Most of the publications in health-related topics reviewed by Carlsen and Glenton (2011) provided no justification regarding the number of focus groups used in their studies. For the 37 studies which justified their reason for the total number of focus groups conducted, the main reason was saturation (28), while other reasons were recommendation by the literature (6) or practical reasons (3).	In these papers insufficient reporting of sample sizes was common. Thirty seven (17%) studies attempted to explain the number of groups. Six studies referred to rules of thumb in the literature, three stated that they were unable to organize more groups for practical reasons, while 28 studies stated that they had reached a point of saturation.	0.2972027063369751	good
Many researchers, however, work on projects that require the total number of focus groups planned to be stated in the proposal before the project starts (Carlsen and Glenton 2011).	many researchers work on assignment and their funders may require that the number of groups are decided pre-study [2,4,12]. 	0.2984143793582916	good
This study reached saturation when the data was deemed both thick and rich, no new themes emerged from focus group discussions, and five focus groups had been completed (136,139).

Although saturation was reached after only a relatively small number of focus groups, this was thought to be beneficial in allowing more in-depth analysis (Carlsen and Glenton 2011).	when authors had included only a small number of focus groups, they frequently described this as a limitation. However, in several of these studies, authors also claimed the number of focus groups had been determined by data saturation. This should, in theory, imply that the number of focus groups was, in fact, appropriate. (See for example [38-43]). But while authors often described a small number of focus groups as a weakness, several studies justified their choice of method with reference to the possibilities that focus groups gave to go in depth and provide a thick description of the issue. 	0.24371235072612762	error
When a researcher derives no new data from interviewing, reviewing documents, or observing behaviors of additional cases, data saturation occurs (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).	Strauss and Corbin state that researchers should collect data until “no new or relevant data seem to emerge regarding a category.” [15] (1990:188). However, the authors present no definition of “new or relevant data”, and give no advice regarding the number of interviews with no new information that is required before the researcher can be reasonably certain that saturation has been reached. 	0.26603734493255615	error

Initially, I proposed including 4-6 teachers in each focus group for several reasons. First, this represents a number that facilitates good interaction while giving each group member quality opportunities to interact (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).	Guidance on group size is common and seldom goes beyond a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 12 participants per group [2,5,6,13]. 	0.2239435911178589	error
Focus groups that contain too many members are problematic by possibly limiting the amount of time each member may participate, which, in turn, limits the amount of rich data produced, particularly in a 60-90 minute interview (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).	Quantity must be balanced against quality, and the more hours of taped interviews or pages of transcribed material, the less depth and richness the authors will be able to extract from the material [21]. 	0.21560335159301758	good

while the focus group interview is a method of collecting research through group discussions and is based on the participants’ perceptions and experiences, its main focus is the interaction among the participants (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).	A focus group or focus interview is commonly defined as a method of collecting research data through moderated group discussion based on the participants’ perceptions and experience of a topic decided by the researcher [1-6].

The authors acknowledge the small sample size of participants. Ideally, focus groups should comprise between four and twelve participants (Kitzinger, 1995; Carlsen and Glenton, 2011).
