Other design approaches, such as grounded theory, are similarly inappropriate because the purpose of grounded theory is to compare empirical findings to the conceptual theory based on inductive interpretation (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).	Background: Focus group studies are increasingly published in health related journals, but we know little abouthow researchers use this method, particularly how they determine the number of focus groups to conduct. Themethodological literature commonly advises researchers to follow principles of data saturation, although practicaladvise on how to do this is lacking. Our objectives were firstly, to describe the current status of sample size infocus group studies reported in health journals. Secondly, to assess whether and how researchers explain thenumber of focus groups they carry out. Methods: We searched PubMed for studies that had used focus groups and that had been published in open access journals during 2008, and extracted data on the number of focus groups and on any explanation authorsgave for this number. We also did a qualitative assessment of the papers with regard to how number of groupswas explained and discussed. Results: We identified 220 papers published in 117 journals. In these papers insufficient reporting of sample sizes was common. The number of focus groups conducted varied greatly (mean 8.4, median 5, range 1 to 96). Thirtyseven (17%) studies attempted to explain the number of groups. Six studies referred to rules of thumb in theliterature, three stated that they were unable to organize more groups for practical reasons, while 28 studies statedthat they had reached a point of saturation. Among those stating that they had reached a point of saturation,several appeared not to have followed principles from grounded theory where data collection and analysis is aniterative process until saturation is reached. Studies with high numbers of focus groups did not offer explanationsfor number of groups. Too much data as a study weakness was not an issue discussed in any of the reviewedpapers. Conclusions: Based on these findings we suggest that journals adopt more stringent requirements for focus groupmethod reporting. The often poor and inconsistent reporting seen in these studies may also reflect the lack ofclear, evidence-based guidance about deciding on sample size. More empirical research is needed to developfocus group methodology. 	0.14290480315685272	error
The quality of a study is also limited based on the skills of the researcher and the researcher’s personal bias (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011).

Carlsen and Glenton (2011) reviewed more than 200 studies published in health-related journals and found that there was a great deal of variation in the number of focus groups used, ranging from 1 to 96. In these publications, all single-group researchers applied mixed methods, where focus groups were used as a pilot study to develop instruments for the quantitative stage of the research. At the other end of the scale, when the number of focus groups used was ten or more, researchers appeared to be attempting to quantify and thus to generalise their research findings.

Most of the publications in health-related topics reviewed by Carlsen and Glenton (2011) provided no justification regarding the number of focus groups used in their studies. For the 37 studies which justified their reason for the total number of focus groups conducted, the main reason was saturation (28), while other reasons were recommendation by the literature (6) or practical reasons (3).	Background: Focus group studies are increasingly published in health related journals, but we know little abouthow researchers use this method, particularly how they determine the number of focus groups to conduct. Themethodological literature commonly advises researchers to follow principles of data saturation, although practicaladvise on how to do this is lacking. Our objectives were firstly, to describe the current status of sample size infocus group studies reported in health journals. Secondly, to assess whether and how researchers explain thenumber of focus groups they carry out. Methods: We searched PubMed for studies that had used focus groups and that had been published in open access journals during 2008, and extracted data on the number of focus groups and on any explanation authorsgave for this number. We also did a qualitative assessment of the papers with regard to how number of groupswas explained and discussed. Results: We identified 220 papers published in 117 journals. In these papers insufficient reporting of sample sizes was common. The number of focus groups conducted varied greatly (mean 8.4, median 5, range 1 to 96). Thirtyseven (17%) studies attempted to explain the number of groups. Six studies referred to rules of thumb in theliterature, three stated that they were unable to organize more groups for practical reasons, while 28 studies statedthat they had reached a point of saturation. Among those stating that they had reached a point of saturation,several appeared not to have followed principles from grounded theory where data collection and analysis is aniterative process until saturation is reached. Studies with high numbers of focus groups did not offer explanationsfor number of groups. Too much data as a study weakness was not an issue discussed in any of the reviewedpapers. Conclusions: Based on these findings we suggest that journals adopt more stringent requirements for focus groupmethod reporting. The often poor and inconsistent reporting seen in these studies may also reflect the lack ofclear, evidence-based guidance about deciding on sample size.
